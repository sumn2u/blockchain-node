# blockchain-node
Decentralized block chain in nodejs repo
A very simple blockchain implementation to demonstrate the basics of blockchains. This is by no means a complete implementation and it is by no means secure!

In the `src/` directory you'll find blockchain code:

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
